Christmas is coming up so I went ahead and got myself (and some family) a Kindle Fire HD 7" tablet.  While playing around with the Kindle, I thought I would pull throw-up on the Silk browser.  I noticed two things:

* I was crazy to show the sidebar in portait mode on a 7" tablet.  The text gets way too tall.

but more importantly:

* there is a "reading view" that shows only the content from my blog post.

I was surprised to see this appear on my site and to see it work and work well.  As it turns out, it's just grabbing the article tags on my page and displaying them in the order they appear on the page (and maybe doing some other things.  I didn't thoroughly research how it worked).  

It was cool to see that happen without me really having to do anything, besides make what is considered a good design choice according to [w3](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_article.asp):

> An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.

I would be lying if I said I did that from the beginning.  I actually made some slight view changes so that the disqus widget wasn't rendered with the article as I wrote this.  Now my reading view is pristine on Silk.
